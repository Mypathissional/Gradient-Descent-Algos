# Gradient-Descent-Algos
This repo contains an implementation of famous Gradient Descent Algorithms in Matlab such as :

Classical Gradient Descent
Momentum Method
Nesterov Momentum Method
AdaGrad
RMSprop
Adam
The code also alows to make visualization of the algos for famous functions such as:

3humpcamel
Ackley
Matyas
Easom
quadratic
Rastrigin
An example of code use can be seen in run.m.

The folders with the name of multidim functions contain the visualization results of the algos for 2dim case. Hist contains the histograms of the results of the algos for different initialization points and params. Giphs contain visualization giph results for several functions
